<h2>Abstract</h2><p>
The Building Assessment Ontology is a consice ontology, developed to semantically describe standards, building codes, certification schemes and regulations in the AEC industry. 

It's aim is to make the integration of such schemes with the actual building easier, to automate the performance evaluation of buildings. The ontology could describe both simple assessment criteria and complex algorithms with multiple parameters.

The ontology has been developed based on common certification schemes related to building performance (including LEED v4.1 O+M, BREEAM In-Use, WELL v2, Green Star - Performance, Energy Star, Green Globes EB and BOMA BEST Sustainable Buildings 3.0)</p>
